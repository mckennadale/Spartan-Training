# Code Institute: First Milestone Project
# Spartan Training

![Website on different platforms](assets/images/reposnsive-website.png)

Spartan Training is a fictional fitness website that aims to help and inform people on how to achieve their fitness goals. My aim with this project was to create a website for the user to learn more about workouts and diet plans with the option to sign-up for futher workout information.

I got the idea for this project to provide users with quick access to both workouts and diet plans as I found it difficult to locate a site that provides both pieces of information so readily. As I had just completed an introductory module on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, I decided to implement HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in different ways throughout my project.

This was the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a static and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

# UX
## Main Aims

To provide a platform for users to learn more about workouts and diet plans in a community based enviorment.

To make the website look high value and appealing to the user through CSS and Bootstrap and the chance to sign up for more information regarding workouts and diet plans.

To make information regarding the workouts and diet plans quickly available to the user with videos showing how tohe workout should be done for the user.

To make it easy for users to make their way through each feature on the website, by having a navigation bar.

To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

# User Stories
The following User Stories helped me to create a design that would satisfy the needs of various types of users.

### Project stakeholders
I am the creator of this platform and want to see it grow and succeed. I would like to attract users in the hope of helping users achieve their fitness goals and obtaining their best possible physique, and also increase the number of users who sign-up to the platform.
### New user
I am a user who has never really had an interest in physical activity. I want to use this website to learn more about workouts and diet plans and implement them into my lifestyle.
### Returning user
I have used this website to learn more about workouts especially the form that should be used with specific excercises by watching the videos, this has enabled me to get better results from my workouts and also prevents injuries.
### Tablet user
I am a user who prefers using my Ipad to browse the internet. I want to have a good experience on this website and enjoy the content as if I was using a desktop or laptop.

# Design Process

### Strategy plane: From the onset, I knew that my primary aim was to help users have quick easy access to high quality workouts and diet plan material, in a way that made users feel part of something, engaging and memorable. As I had just begun to develop my Coding skills, my aim for this particular project was to design a project that combined what I have learned so far. I then started the UX process by creating a list of User Stories above, they enabled me to create a platform the would find valuable and useful.

### Scope plane: Having decided the main purpose for the project, I began identfying the key features i wanted the platform to feature. To do so, I focused on the features and style I wanted to implement, as I knew this would be important in creating an enjoyable experience for the user. This led me to decide that I wanted to focus on a site with three features: a workout page, a meal plan page and a sign up page.

### Strcuture plane: Once I had the features I wanted to include, I began to structure my design into four seperate pages: 'Home', 'Workouts', 'Meal Plans', 'Sign Up'. The 'Home' page would welcome users to the project with a inspiring hero image and info regarding the company. The user can then continue to 'Workouts' to learn and see a daily workouts, the user can then proceed to: 'Meal Plans'. The user can then proceed to the 'Sign Up' page to sign up for new workouts and meal plans.

### Skeleton plane: As though out in the structre plane, I considered the main way for the user to navigate the website, through the a fixed navbar. The reason for this was to give the user a simple way to navigate through the site. The user can navigate through the site a view the content eaily learning about workous and meal plans before then having the option to sign up.

### Surface plane:

* For my design to work, I knew that it would be extremely important to create a platform that looked high value and created a community feel to stand out from the competition. There is a lot of bodybuilding and gym sites, as nowadays it has become a really popular area with lots of content available to internet users. My first design decision was to create a platform that stood out and scramed different from all other workout sites, rather than something users have seen before, with valuable color scheme and inspiring images that would inspire the user and make them buy into the Spartan community.

* With this aim, I began creating and experimenting with my wireframes on wireframe.cc. As this was my first Milestone Project I found this difficult to master at the beginning, I found it useful to see the layout of my design on a screen as opposed to just in my head. When settling on the color scheme I went with traditional Spartan colors of gold and red: I began searching the red and gold that would best represent Spartan Training, I used the website HTML Color Codes which gives suggestions of which colors compliment each other, the red (#BB0627) was found on HTML Color Codes, whilst the gold rgba(187, 154, 6, .7) compliments the red color well and really embodies the color of a spartan warrior.

* I used Google Fonts to selct the fonts that would be used in my project. I wanted to find two similar fonts that would fit in with the spartan theme i had envisioned for my site. As a result, I settled for Orbitron for the majority of the site and Raleway for other parts.

* With the wireframes complete. I created the basic structure and code with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap from my earlier modules the Code Institute gave outstanding examples of using the Bootstrap grid system and great design ideas.

## Note:
*The original color scheme for the site was to be sky blue and white as can be seen from the wireframes below. However this did not really represent the look and feel i wanted the site to have. There was alos some structural changes made to the original wireframes as they did not give the value i had been hoping they would.*

# Testing

The testing process is outlined below. It includes:

* Testing User Stories
* Validating HTML and CSS code
* Checking website compatibility on different browsers
* Checking responsiveness of design on all screen sizes
* Manually testing the functionality of all links
* Manually testing the workout page features
* Manually testing the sign up form


## Testing User Stories
The following tests were to test the experience of each user mentioned earlier. 

### Project stakeholders
The creator of this project wanted a consistent and motivating design to inspire, encourage and attract users. This is acheived thorugh a beautiful color scheme that says to the user this is a high value site, along with powerful images that should inspire and motivate the user. Through this the creator would feel confident that a positive user experience would lead to more traffic for the webiste resulting in more people signing up and increasing the size of the Spartan community.

### New users
New user (who is new to physical activity):

This user was completely new to physical activity, they would come to this website to learn more. Testing their navigation leads to the following journey through the website:
* Home: The user can scroll down the homepage reading information about Spartan Training inspiring them before proceeding to the other pages.
* Workouts: By clicking workouts on the navbar the user can scroll through various workouts reading each daily workout with the option of clicking a "See How To Do It" button to view the workout before trying it for themselves.
* Meal Plans: By clicking workouts on the navbar the user can scroll through meal plans ranging from Monday to Friday, with different meals for each day.
* Sign Up: Having gone trhough each of the websites pages the user can then sign up to Spartan Training for weekly workout and meal plan tips, once they press sign up a modal pops up thanking the user for signing up the modal can be closed and the user will remain on the sign up page, alternatively the user can click the back to homepage button which brings the user back to the homepage.
* This user would leave with a positive experience, confident that they know more now than they did before.

### Returning users

Returning user (who is familiar with physical activity but wants to learn more):
* As a returning user, this user has previously visited the website to learn new workouts. Now they want to remind themselves of the form that should be used when performing these excercises to prevent injury.
* From the home page, select 'Workouts' from the navbar.
* Scroll down to the particualr workout they want to view and click the "see How You Do It" button which loads the video instructing the user on how to perform the excericse safely and effectively.

### Tablet user

As an Ipad user, this user wanted to browse the site on an ipad and enjoy the content as if they were using a laptop or desktop.
* Certain elements are presented in rows, as opposed to columns to allow a visually satisfying experience.


## Validating the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code

### HTML
My HTML code was passed through the W3C Markup Validation Service. Doing so brought up the errors below that I resolved in the following ways:

index.html - My homepage was missing some closing div tags, although this did not visually cause any errors on the page it did not pass the validation service so I had to review my code to correct this.
workout.html - This file passed without any errors.
meal-plans.html - This file passed without any errors.
sign-up.html - On my sign-up page i was giving two errors by the Vaildation Service, the value for the attribute type was incorrect as I had "button submit" this was changed to just submit and the other error was that the anchor element must not appear as a descendant of the button element, I changed this by nesting the button element in a form element instaed which linked the user back to the homepage. This can be seen below.

![Sign-Up page changes](assets/images/sign-up-form-change.PNG)


### CSS
I checked my CSS code with the W3C Markup Validation Service. This produced three errors.
* Error one and two was there was a comma missing between fonts in the font-family style rule.
* Error three was a .my-3 error this was a piece of code that I had forgotten to remove from my style sheet so this just had to be erased from the style sheet. Please see these errors below.

### Testing compatibility with different browsers

I manually tested the website on the following web browsers, checking that buttons, responsiveness and design worked as planned:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari

### Testing the design's responsiveness on several screen sizes

I manually tested the design of the live project by doing the following:

* Using Google Developer Tools to view the project on devices with different screen sizes.
* Checking whether the images and content was presented in an organised and structered way.
* Making sure the navbar transformed into a hamburger menu on smaller devices
* Asking for feedback from friends and family who opened and interacted with the project on their devices.

### Results and changes
* These manual tests led to minor changes in spacing and sizes of various content on the site.
* One noticable change was the size of the navbar brand as this would push the hamburger menu onto the next line as it was too large on smaller devices.

### Manually testing the functionality of all links

The following tests were made to see that all links responded as they should:

* Social media links were clicked on to make sure that they open in a new tab at the correct corresponding landing page.
* Navbar items were clicked on from each page to make sure that they navigate to the correct page.
* All buttons were clicked on to check that they take the user to the correct page.
* The modal is displayed ehn the sign button is clicked on the sign up page.
* Clicking on the logo in the navbar leads the user back to the home page.
* All buttons on the workout page take the user to the correct youtube page showing the user how to do the workout.
