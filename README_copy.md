# Code Institute: First Milestone Project
# Spartan Training

Spartan Training is a fictional fitness website that aims to help and inform people on how to achieve their fitness goals. My aim with this project was to create a website for the user to learn more about workouts and diet plans with the option to sign-up for futher workout information.

I got the idea for this project to provide users with quick access to both workouts and diet plans as I found it difficult to locate a site that provides both pieces of information so readily. As I had just completed an introductory module on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, I decided to implement HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in different ways throughout my project.

This was the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a static and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

To make it easy for users to make their way through each feature on the website, by having a navigation bar.

To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

# User Stories
The following User Stories helped me to create a design that would satisfy the needs of various types of users.

# Project stakeholders
I am the creator of this platform and want to see it grow and succeed. I would like to attract users in the hope of helping users achieve their fitness goals and obtaining their best possible physique, and also increase the number of users who sign-up to the platform.
# New user
I am a user who has never really had an interest in physical activity. I want to use this website to learn more about workouts and diet plans and implement them into my lifestyle.

I have used this website to learn more about workouts especially the form that should be used with specific excercises by watching the videos, this has enabled me to get better results from my workouts and also prevents injuries.
# Tablet user
I am a user who prefers using my Ipad to browse the internet. I want to have a good experience on this website and enjoy the content as if I was using a desktop or laptop.

# Design Process

Strategy plane: From the onset, I knew that my primary aim was to help users have quick easy access to high quality workouts and diet plan material, in a way that made users feel part of something, engaging and memorable. As I had just begun to develop my Coding skills, my aim for this particular project was to design a project that combined what I have learned so far. I then started the UX process by creating a list of User Stories above, they enabled me to create a platform the would find valuable and useful.

Scope plane: Having decided the main purpose for the project, I began identfying the key features i wanted the platform to feature. To do so, I focused on the features and style I wanted to implement, as I knew this would be important in creating an enjoyable experience for the user. This led me to decide that I wanted to focus on a site with three features: a workout page, a meal plan page and a sign up page.

Strcuture plane: Once I had the features I wanted to include, I began to structure my design into four seperate pages: 'Home', 'Workouts', 'Meal Plans', 'Sign Up'. The 'Home' page would welcome users to the project with a inspiring hero image and info regarding the company. The user can then continue to 'Workouts' to learn and see a daily workouts, the user can then proceed to: 'Meal Plans'. The user can then proceed to the 'Sign Up' page to sign up for new workouts and meal plans.
